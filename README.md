# DD_CDFs
Table of EoS and Internal parameters of neutron stars from density-dependent functional 

Results for the three covariant density functionals (CDFs) are located within the 
directories DD2_famils, DDME2_family, and DD_MPE_family.  In each of these directories, 
the equations of state are given in the EOS directory, and the integral parameters of stars
in the directory TOV. Each file contains a self-explanatory indication of each column. 

The results for hybrid stars are located in TOV_Hybrid where we provide the integral parameters 
of hybrid stars.
