# DD_CDFs
Tables of EoS and integral parameters of neutron stars from density-dependent functional.

Results for the three covariant density functionals (CDFs) are located within the 
directories DD2_famils, DDME2_family, and DD_MPE_family.  In each of these directories, 
the equations of state are given in the EOS directory. The integral parameters of stars,
such as mass, radius, and tidal deformability are given in the directory TOV. Each file 
contains self-explanatory labeling of each column. 

The results for hybrid stars are located in TOV_Hybrid where we provide the integral 
parameters of hybrid stars. The construction of EoS can be done the basis of EoS given 
for nucleonic models and addition of constant speed of sound EoS for quark matter.
